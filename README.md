Open a Linux terminal.
Place yourself in the directory that contains the files to create the docker.
Use the command "docker-compose up".
Once this is printed "Ready to accept connections", open a navigator and go to "localhost:5001".
The code in the file app.py should be executed on this page.

To stop docker, go back to your terminal and use CTRL+C and use the command "docker-compose down".
